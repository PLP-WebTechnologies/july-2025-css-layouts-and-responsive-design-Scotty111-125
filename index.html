            Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, is a vibrant and fast-growing metropolis known as the economic and political hub of the country. Often referred to as the "Green City in the Sun," it blends modern skyscrapers with lush green spaces such as Uhuru Park and Nairobi National Park, a unique wildlife sanctuary located just outside the city center. Nairobi is home to diverse cultures, bustling markets, international organizations, and a thriving technology scene, earning it the nickname “Silicon Savannah.” Its dynamic energy, rich history, and role as a gateway to East Africa make it one of the most influential cities on the continent.
